When every shot counts, only one player will never fail you. Chezirish joined our family and within days of downloading Cube, was completely rifle-owning everyone! Maybe it's his long history in CS:GO and HL2DM, his deep tactical mindset, or low mouse sensitivity that makes gives him the amazing precision he has. Aside from being an insane player, Chezirish is a simply wonderful guy, always so nice and helpful in every way! We're so blessed to have him in our family!
