Dear Plasma,
  Well, it's been an amazing journey. Ever since Marta and Proze first met you and brought you into our family, you've been our heart and soul, the one who holds us together through. You held our hand through our first clanwar victories, and inspired us to reach to the next level as individuals and as a team. With you by our side, 'eS has achieved far more than our biggest dreams. All we have left to do is.. keep you from rushing to enemies in duels! ;)
  What can I say.. the time we've spent with you has been the most wonderful and uplifting time of our lives. Words can't express how much you mean to us; your indescribable beauty, your heart of gold, your dedication and love, is the greatest of God's treasures on earth. We have a wonderful future together ahead of us!
