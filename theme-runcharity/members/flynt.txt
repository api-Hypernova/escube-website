Flynt: As our newest member, you have shown us your strength, your love, your potential, and there is nothing we can't love about you. In fact, you are a crazy LOTR fan like all of us, so you are pretty much like all of us. You are amazing in effic and ectf and we have all promised that you will get better by our training, and we all see the good results of that. You are far away from us, but still our love makes you so close to us. We see a bright future with you, and we know that you are one of us. You are funny, and make jokes always. You never even say "no" LOL! We love you!
