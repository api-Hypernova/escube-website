Our dearest clanleader, Latté. Isn't it much to tell about you? We had hoped you would leave us more space, but I guess Newton doesn't like astronomy. Well, you're a PARADISE of a boy! Hmm, where shall we start? I had hoped you would stand for all the thinking, genius, but you are just a lazy geek waiting to get compliments, aren't you? I guess Newton never went for a jogging trip out in the woods, maybe he thought that apples would hit him again. Well enough jokes for now.
Let us take a look at your nickname. Latté. It describes you perfectly. A 6-o'clock awakener but as delicious as a cup of good old Nescafe Latté. All these hearts flying from our screens every morning, and directly to our heart. Yes, we keep them, in the centre and in the brightest part, where you belong. You are our emoji-spamming leader, a fresh cup of refreshing hearts at 6 o'clock, a noob in insta LOL ( You need alot of training in that from us), Plasma's psychologist, big brother & little brother, a tech geek, a office guy LOL, and an awesome effic player + 1000 more things. But that is not what makes you great!, It is your kindness and the most golden heart of us all which you use to make us play more Sauer. But don't ever duel this guy, he will make you never ever read science again. You would wonder, oh my, is there gravity on sauer, after seeing his moves? And you will just die of questions after dueling him.
The truth is, you are JUST lovely, and we love you so much, that we can't love you everyday, incase we can't love you tomorrow. Only a genius would get that. SO YOU better understand it! You certainly are a dreamer and a dream for us. We really don't need to dream anymore, we feel safe with an clanleader like you. For now, i just want you to know this: "We ride together, we die together".... not in Sauer though, cause you always die first. We don't love you that much, only a cup of latté, thats how much <3
