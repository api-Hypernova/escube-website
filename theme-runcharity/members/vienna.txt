'eS|Vienna, an oldskool Cube player, is slowly making her comeback! Vienna has been a loyal member of 'eS ever since the beginning in 2011, where she dominated in instagib for two years. After going inactive for a while due to school, she's finally back with us again! When not practicing in Cube, Vienna enjoys playing piano, cooking, hanging out with friends, and 3D computer graphics artwork. Keep it up Vienna! We can't wait to have you back in clanwars with us! <3
