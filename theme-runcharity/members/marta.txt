Marta is the most perfect clan founder anyone could have asked for. Her long term vision and dedication to our family has brought us to where we stand. Besides being the cutest sister in the world, her jokes will always brighten your day and her smile will take you to a new world. When not playing Sauer, Marta can be found reading books, baking sweets, playing violin, dancing to Trance music, writing Perl code, and hanging out with her little brothers and sisters. We love you so much Marta!! We wouldn't be here without you!! <3
